                <p>Kidney failure is a major healthcare problem, and transplanting a new kidney is sometimes the only medical solution. 
				Less than 10% patients with kidney failure undergo a kidney transplant with a family donor and 1% do so with a kidney from a deceased donor (someone who has died and their organs have been donated). The rest of the patients with kidney failure remain on dialysis because they do not find a deceased donor, 
				don’t have a family donor, or the family donor that they do have is incompatible. <br/> Don't Worry join the community of hundreds of such people who are looking for swap transplants. It's Free!!!</p>

            <h2>Kidney Transplant</h2>
            <p>When your kidneys fail, treatment is needed to replace the work your own kidneys can no longer do.  There are two types of treatment for kidney failure — dialysis or transplant. Many people feel that a kidney transplant offers more freedom and a better quality of life than dialysis.  In making a decision about whether this is the best treatment for you, you may find it helpful to talk to people who already have a kidney transplant. You also need to speak to your doctor, nurse and family members.</p>

            <h2>Liver Transplant</h2>
            <p>A liver transplant is a surgical procedure that removes a liver that no longer functions properly (liver failure) and replaces it with a healthy liver from a living or deceased donor.</p>
			<p>Liver transplant is usually reserved as a treatment option for people who have significant complications due to end-stage chronic liver disease. In rare cases, sudden failure of a previously normal liver may occur.</p>
			<p>The number of people waiting for a liver transplant greatly exceeds the number of available deceased-donor livers.</p>
			<p>The human liver regenerates and returns to its normal size shortly after surgical removal of part of the organ. This makes living-donor liver transplant an alternative to waiting for a deceased-donor liver to become available.</p>

            <h2>Organ Swapping</h2>
            <p>Organ (Kidney or liver) exchange or ‘swap’ is a simple barter system. It is a ’give and take’ deal between two pairs of people, each pair consisting of a giver and a taker, where each pair benefits by receiving a suitably matched organ. In this simple barter framework, it is possible to maximise returns exponentially when the pool is large and complex algorithms for exchange are built into it.</p>
			<p>A swap pair consists of a recipient (patient) and a donor (a family member). These pairs are such that they cannot ordinarily donate an organ to each other. This could happen because of blood group incompatibility or a tissue incompatibility. Such pairs can register with us. we will search across the database for compatible pairs.</p>

            <p class="lead">A Swap transplant involves an exchange of organs between two families, who cannot donate the organ to their own family member because of blood group mismatch. This is in a sense ‘paired exchange’.</p>
			<p class="lead">This would minimize this shortfall of organs and increase transplant numbers legally. In this method there is a mechanism for organ sharing between two unrelated donor-recipient pairs.</p>
			<p class="lead">By doing a swap, two patients with kidney failure who in normal circumstances cannot undergo a transplant because of blood group mismatch within that family, can now go ahead with kidney transplantation.</p>
			<p class="lead">Once there is a match, your nephrologist will be informed and your surgery will be done by your transplant team at the hospital of your choice. <u>We will only generate compatible pairs, hand them over to the respective nephrologists and not do anything beyond this.</u></p>

            <p class="lead">We are merely a match-making agency. Once a patient is referred to us, he would be registered and as soon as a possible swap match is generated by the database, this information would be conveyed to the two primary Nephrologists of the two patients. Further workup, assessment, legal formalities, organisation of the logistics of the transplant as well as the procedure of transplant would be the prerogative of these two nephrologists, in mutual consultation."</p>
